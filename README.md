# React Form Validation | Zod, React-Hook-Form

I'm currently learning React, TypeScript and the entire ecosystem of technologies around them. Looking for React topics to learn on youtube, I came across how to handle forms in React. So I watched some videos about it and got a chance to see Zod and React-Hook-Form in action and I'm in love with these stacks now.

After watching the videos, I was inspired to do a project myself, using the new technologies I learned. So I developed this project, even though it's a simple project, mostly used for study, I really learned a lot about how to use these stacks and how powerful they are.
